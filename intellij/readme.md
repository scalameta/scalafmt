# [Intellij plugin for scalafmt](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8236)

This project is not part of the main scalafmt sbt build. You need to setup
a custom IntelliJ project to work on the scalafmt IntelliJ plugin.

* Install within IntelliJ plugin repository.
* To setup the project, follow [these Jetbrains instructions](http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/creating_plugin_project.html).
* Most of the code is from [scalariform-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/thesamet/scalariform-intellij-plugin).

Help wanted! There is an [sbt plugin to create sbt plugins](https://github.com/dancingrobot84/sbt-idea-plugin).
I would love to use that plugin to make the setup simpler.
