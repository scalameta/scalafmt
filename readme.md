### Overview
Scalafmt is a code formatter for Scala that does its best to make your code
look readable, idiomatic and consistent.
When your lines get really long, scalafmt makes them short again.

### Warning
This project is under active development and is far from production ready.

Main issues:
* Can't format large files (200+ LOC) in less than 200ms.
* Occasionally produces invalid code.

### Documentation
For now, [the tests](src/test/resources) are the most up-to-date documentation.

### Installation

*NOTE.* Installing is awkward at the moment. It will get easier once the tool matures.

There are two options:

1. Build from source (recommended)
  * clone the repo
  * run `sbt assembly`, master branch should pass tests
  * `target/scala-2.11/scalafmt.jar` should exist
2. Download pre-built scalafmt.jar
  * Go to [releases](https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/releases) and
    download the latest `scalafmt.jar`.

### Create scalafmt executable

Create a script named `scalafmt` somewhere in your `PATH` with the command

```
java -Droot-level=error -jar </PATH/TO>scalafmt.jar $@
```

Then you can use the formatter like this:

```
scalafmt --file MyCode.scala
```

For more details

```
scalafmt --help
```

#### Vim

* install [vim-autoformat](https://github.com/Chiel92/vim-autoformat)
* add to your `.vimrc`

```vim
noremap <F5> :Autoformat<CR> "" Optional
let g:formatdef_scalafmt = "'scalafmt'"
let g:formatters_scala = ['scalafmt']
```
* run `:Autoformat` or `F5`

#### IntelliJ

*NOTE.* Does not support undo after formatting.

* Open settings, create a `scalafmt` "external tool"

* Assign a shortcut to `scalafmt`

### Updates

* Feb 16th
  * Ran benchmarks against Scalariform. I'm not surprised `scalafmt` is
    **significantly** slower since 1. I've done little optimizations and 2.
    `scalafmt` supports column-width limit which introduces a huge overhead.

```
* Feb 12th
  * Ran scalafmt on all [scala-js][scalajs] files with a 200ms timeout.
  The formatter completed before timeout on 68 files and timed out on 848 files.
* Feb 9rd
  * pre-release https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/releases/tag/v0.1.0
* Feb 3rd
  * [Sneak peek output from the
  formatter](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/blob/htmlpreview/reports/scalafmt-feb3.html).
  The red regions are spots where the formatter's performance still suffers.
  * The actual implementation, under `src/main/scala/`, is 684 LOC, excluding blank lines and comments and including some debugging stuff.
  * Running time for a ~500 LOC file is around 5 seconds. Will hopefully
  reach <100ms soon. Last week the formatter choked on 10 LOC (exponential
  growth, yay).
  * There is one style to begin with, adapted from the [Scala.js coding
  style](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/blob/master/CODINGSTYLE.md).
  Support for
  configuration flags comes later.
  * The formatter uses [scala.meta's](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta)
  tokens and AST. The implementation works mostly on the token level, but
  relies heavily on the AST for "smarter" features.
  * Still haven't covered some common cases (like breaking before `.` in
  `a.b(c)`), so the output looks weird in some cases.
