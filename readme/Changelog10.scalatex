    See @lnk("merged PRs", "https://github.com/scalameta/scalafmt/milestone/17?closed=1").

  @ul
    @li
      IntelliJ plugin now supports a custom path for .scalafmt.conf, by
      @user{vovapolu}. See Tools > Scalafmt > Relative path to scalafmt config.
    @li
      IntelliJ plugin now also tries to read .scalafmt.conf from the project's
      VCS root, by @user{stuhood}.
    @li
      New option @sect.ref{spaces.afterKeywordBeforeParen}, by @user{nrinaudo}.
    @li
      New option @sect.ref{newlines.alwaysBeforeElseAfterCurlyIf},
      by @user{nrinaudo}.
    @li
      sbt-scalafmt now supports sbt 1.0!
    @li
      scalafmt-cli now fails fast on invalid .scalafmt.conf when invoked with
      no cli args, @issue(1012).
    @li
      Off-by-one error for def and class definitions fixed, thanks @user{densh} for
      reporting. Expect diffs when upgrading.
    @li
      Our CI now checks for binary compatibility issues on every PR.
      Binary compatibility is not guaranteed for the packages
      @code{org.scalafmt.internal} and
      @code{org.scalafmt.config}.

@sect{1.1.0}
  @ul
    @li
      An off-by-one error in @code{maxColumn} has now been fixed, @issue(976).
      Expect significant diffs from upgrading to this version.
      To get the previous behavior, set @code{maxColumn=n-1} if you previously
      enabled @code{maxColumn=n}.
    @li
      Scalafmt now uses a lenient 'dialect' by default.
      This means that it's no longer necessary to configure
      @code{runner.dialect} to format files using new Scala syntax such as
      trailing commas, @code{inline} keyword, literal types, trait parameters.
    @li
      scalafmt-cli reports errors to stdout by default unless --stdin or --stdout
      are specified. This help fix issues on Windows.
@sect{1.0.0}
  This release was identical to @sect.ref{1.0.0-RC4}.
@sect{1.0.0-RC4}
  @ul
    @li
      Include the commit for the regression fix that was supposed to be
      included in RC3, see @issue(973).
@sect{1.0.0-RC3}
  If no major issues are reported within one week of this release, then it
  will be promoted to v1.0.
  @ul
    @li
      Fix regression in RC2 @issue(973).
    @li
      Arrows in @code{case} pattern matching are now vertically aligned.
      Concretely,
      @config{align.tokens = [caseArrow]} by default now, it was @config{align.tokens = []} before.
      This decision was voted upon on in @issue(890) with 23 votes in favor and
      9 votes against.
    @li
      The cli now enables @code{-i} by default, to get the old behavior
      pass in the flag @code{--stdout}, by @user{pjrt}.
    @li
      The cli @code{--files} flag is now optional, this means @code{scalafmt Foo.scala}
      will write the formatted output into that file, by @user{pjrt}.
    @li
      @config{optIn.annotationNewlines = true} by default now, it was @code{false}.
      See @issue(942) for motivation.
    @li
      @config{spaces.beforeContextBoundColon = IfMultipleBounds} is now supported,
      see @issue(916), by @user{hejfelix}.
    @li
      @config{newlines.alwaysBeforeTopLevelStatements = true} now skips nested blocks,
      see @issue(933), by @user{Daxten}.
    @li
      Fixed off-by-one error with line wrapping around assignments, see @issue(600),
      by @user{aeons}.
    @li
      @code{bestEffortInDeeplyNestedCode} has been removed. This option was unsafe
      and a maintenance burden. See @sect.ref{Deeply nested code} for possible workarounds.
    @li
      Fixed issues with file not found errors when running the cli
      outside the git root directory, @issue(960) and @issue(927).

  PS. If you are using sbt-scalafmt, please give @sect.ref{neo-sbt-scalafmt}
